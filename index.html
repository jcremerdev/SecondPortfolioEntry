					  <p> Hey! I'm Joe Cremer. I am from Salt Lake City, Utah and I am a Student at Thinkful! I plan to use the skills I learn at Thinkful in whatever career path I pursue, but I am most interested in working for the FBI. It has been a dream of mine for years to track down the bad guys who terrorize our streets and citizens so that our country and future generations can continue grow with peace of mind knowing that we are in good hands.
					  </p>
            <p> My passions are helping other people within my community as well as leading others by using my own experiences. I am a high school basketball and track & Field coach. I love being there for our next generation of young athletes and leaders. To me, it is the most fulfilling work I'm a part of today.

          <p>
            As someone who is deeply committed to working for their community and future generations, coding allows me to contribute more. Hard skills like coding are in high demand everywhere, as well as the FBI. A software engineer has the opportunity to work for a plethra of companies, which is why I'm so empassioned by the career's opportunites. From Google to SpaceX, there are countless destinations to set my goal paths and I'm thrilled to have this opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            My other passions includes playing sports, such as golf, basketball, volleyball and flag football. I prefer to spend countless hours outside camping and hiking. Traveling is one of my newer passions, as I have always had a love of adventure and finding my way around places that I've only read about. My free time is usually spent with my family or by  playing with my bulldog, Delilah.
